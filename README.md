# CrudaJS

CrudaJS is a pluggable CRUD and data administration JavaScript library for hypertext-driven REST APIs. 

## Main goal

The primary goal of the project is to speed up application development by bringing pluggable fully operational data management front-end for hypermedia-driven REST APIs based applications and to relieve your codebase for more important stuff.

## Features

* **Back-end agnostic**: It doesn't matter in which programming language your hypertext-driven REST API is written. CrudaJS uses [HAL](http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html), while your back-end speaks HAL, CrudaJS will work.
* **Embeddable**: CrudaJS doesn't force you to use a specific UI toolkit, out of the box, CrudaJS provides you simple templates and JavaScript code to live within your application.
